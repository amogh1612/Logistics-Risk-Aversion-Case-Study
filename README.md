# Logistics-Risk-Aversion-Case-Study
As part of the research and development team at Cobotics Business Services LLC, I did a case study of Covid-19 disruption event and developed a risk aversion model for the logistics industry.

Problem: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many abrupt closures of businesses and warehouses.
This made it difficult for shippers and freight forwarders to know if there was anyone available to receive
their cargo at the respective warehouses, costing them unnecessary labor, time, and money. Similar
situation can arise anytime due to different type of geo-political (wars, port strikes) and natural
(hurricanes) events.

Solution: Goal of this study was to extract available information related to any disruption event from the
internet and combine it with the customer’s internal enterprise data to assess its impact and provide
actionable insights. I used Covid-19 disruption event across Logistics industry as a case study.
I collected COVID-19 data published globally and then used Canada as a deep dive. I combined it with one
of our fortune 500-customer’s enterprise order management data from their Canadian operations. I
constructed a method that mapped COVID-19 hot spots to the respective postal codes/counties of the
backlogged orders from the customer’s ERP system from that time. I wrote a recommender system which
can assist shippers to decide whether to hold or ship the orders based on the situation at the receiving
postal code/county at that time. In addition, the recommender system prioritized and expedited orders
with significant revenue impact so those can be shipped out and received before the receiving postal
code/county became a Covid-19 hot spot.

Outcome: Such disruption events are inevitable but by using simple data science algorithms, we can
deliver innovative solutions to minimize the revenue impact and stranded inventory for logistics industry.
